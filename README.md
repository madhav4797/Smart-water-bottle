# Smart-water-bottle

Made a smart water bottle using Raspberry Pi which intimates user to drink water after regular intervals and note down the water intake of the user. The user can set how much amount of water he/she wishes to drink after every interval. This will allow user to stay hydrated every time without remembering when was the last water intake.
